## Motivation

I want to try out gRPC and microservices, the latter are really popular, and the industry standard, but gRPC looks intresting to me, and a better way to intercommunicate

## Description

Small PoC using Golang microservices communicating in-between with gRPC to track whatever media you're currently watching/reading, or have done in the past.

## Use it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jofaval/bingewatch-microservices.git
cd bingewatch-microservices
```

## Tech Stack

- Golang
- gRPC.io
- GORM (Go's ORM)
- Github Actions (probably)
